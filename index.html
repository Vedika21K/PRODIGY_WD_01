      <h2></h2>
      <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a beginner learning web development. I love exploring new tech, designing cool websites, and building fun projects.</p>
      <p>ðŸŽ“ I am a BTech Computer Science and AI/ML student, currently interning at Prodigy InfoTech. I am exploring different domains of technology. I like projects that allow me to implement what I know and discover more about how technology can be used to solve real-life problems.

        <br>
        ðŸ’¡ Apart from development, I am also interested in event management and social media administration. I am learning how individuals communicate online and how communication and planning assist in efficient management. These fields help me understand how technical and non-technical skills complement each other across various industries.
        <br>
        
        ðŸ“– I believe that learning across multiple domains provides me with a balanced skill set, and I am always looking for opportunities to grow. Through internships, projects, and collaborations, I aim to develop both technical and management skills, making me adaptable to different challenges and able to contribute in various roles.</p>
